Value: -141.72472834 BTC

Pattern: CoinJoin

Description:
The substantial transfer to an unfamiliar address is a significant warning signal, especially when there were multiple inputs. This pattern obscures the provenance of funds, likely through the use of CoinJoin. 

The receiving address likely functions as an intermediary, consolidating assets from multiple users to break the observable link between source and destination addresses. The objective is to return BTC (minus fees) originating from unrelated sources, thus effectively severing ties to the original sender. 

Many illict activities uses this level of obfuscation, so this activity is suspicious.
